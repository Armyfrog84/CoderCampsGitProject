  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is John Frosch and I am an aspiring full stack web developer. After not receiving the kind of education and guidance I'd hoped for at my local community college, I made the choice to join Coder Camps to help me along my journey of fulfilling my dream of becoming a developer.</p>

  <h2>My Background</h2>
  <p>I do have experience using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. My only true strong suit is TSql and data modeling thus far. I do currently build WordPress sites for clients as needed.</p>

  <h2>Why I Decided To Learn Programming</h2>
  <p> After 10 years in transportation and logistics, I decided I wanted to create a full featured transportation software suite that would surpass anything currently on the market. After reaching out to a few developers and even VC's being unable to find the right individual that was more concerned with bringing a product to market than capitalizing off of licensing was extremely hard to do. Thus, I chose to become a developer and create it on my own over time.</p>
